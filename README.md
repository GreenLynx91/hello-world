Ode to a Dung Beetle
by Joseph Aloysius McDonough II

There's a little bug that lives out west
  with habits exceedingly crass.
He'll spend hours finding a rabbit turd,
  Just to roll it around in the grass.

On a hot afternoon in the summer,
  the fields are full of these guys.
Each tumbling in random direction
  Each purpose so seemingly wise.
  
Humility can follow
  from seeing how these fellows go
From one divert to another,
  busily to and fro.
  
How similarly we scurry,
  each on his own solo way.
Oh, such important bustling
  filling everyone's day.
  
So, weigh not your doings too heavy
  as they require little wit.
We are very much like these beetles,
  rolling our balls of stuff.
